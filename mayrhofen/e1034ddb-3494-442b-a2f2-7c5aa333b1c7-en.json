  "description": [
    "Our house is on Schwendberg on a sunny and very promising in hill 810 meters above sea level on the Zillertal, a bit off the ramp to the Zillertal High Road and therefore very quiet.\nThe view stretches over the Zillertal valley from Zell am Ziller to Mayrhofen with the almost 3000 m high Ahornspitze. The convenient location means that you both quickly down the valley is (2.5 km or 5-10 minutes by car to Hippach and to the mountain railways) to go skiing or to make excursions and tours throughout the Ziller Valley in the summer, as also quickly up the wide mountain pastures and mountain terrain of the Zillertal High Road, which leads up to an altitude of about 2000 m.\n\nIn our large, renovated in 2007 house, we offer two spacious apartments, Ahornblick and Zillertalblick that offer plenty of space for 2-7 persons each. The new facility is comfortable and modern with separate bedrooms, a beautiful living room with TV and shower and toilet.\n\nBed linen, towels and bath towels are provided.\n",
