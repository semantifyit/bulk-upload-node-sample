    "Hilde\u0027s Skitenne is at 1725 meters above sea level and is located in the middle of the skiing area Horberg-Penken (piste no. 14). The traditional style and natural materials convey an ambience of a special kind, and make Hilde\u0027s ski Tenne a meeting place for young and old.\nFrom the sun terrace you can enjoy a beautiful view of the Zillertal mountains. Sunbathers relax on sun loungers provided by us for free.\n\nWe offer an extensive food offer and Tyrolean specialties. In the preparation of our food, we ensure the highest quality and use predominantly local products. Particularly well known are our daily fresh grilled chicken, pizzas and Hilde\u0027s homemade apple and cheese strudel.\n\nSpeaking of which, a particularly popular spot is our umbrella bar. There\u0027s always something going on.\n\n\n\n\n",
