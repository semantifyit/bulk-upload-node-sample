  "description": [
    "The place to chill out is in the White Lounge. Comfortable deck chairs, laid-back lounge music, trendy cocktails and the joyful anticipation of a night, no one will forget. The White Lounge is also an Igloo Hotel with Igloo Suites for couples or a maximum of four persons. When the sun slips behind the peaks, the stars begin to shine in the sky and a sea of light starts to spread out down in the valley, that’s when guests head out on the romantic torch-lit hike to the restaurant. An enchanting dinner awaits them there. Afterwards it’s only a few minutes torch-lit walk back to the White Lounge. No one feels like getting into the Igloo quite yet. At over 2,000 meters altitude the starry sky is simply too stunning to look at while the campfire creates a very special atmosphere. Then you spend a cosy night tucked into your thick sleeping bag followed by a magnificent sunrise and a gourmet breakfast.  These really are the best prerequisites for enjoying another unforgettable day of your vacation.",
    "Reservations only by persons who have reached the age of 18.\n3 months prior to arrival: the reservation can be resolved without a cancellation fee.\nSurcharge for weekend bookings.\nIndividual offers for parties, weddings, etc. on request.\n",
    "Registration at the cash desk Ahornbahn before 4.00 p.m. Last ascent at  4.30 p.m. with the luggage (transport from top station). Walk along the panorama trail to reach the White Lounge, which is ready for the overnight stay from 5.00 p.m."
