  "description": "No matter if park addicted or rookie, every girl is very welcome to join and progress their skills! The focus lies on having fun and riding together. It is a great chance to meet new people and make friends to shred with.\nAs snowboarding still is a man dominated sport, it is also our aim to win more women for freestyle riding and to support them. During the event all participants get the chance to win prizes of the sponsors at our “Goodies for Tricks Session“.\n\nThe registration for each session is for free and on site.\n",
