  "description": "AN ENTIRE VALLEY TURNS INTO ONE BIG EXPERIENCE!\n\nGet to know the entire valley, its people and its culture: On June 10 and 11, 2017, the entire Zillertal welcomes the alpine summer with an action-packed event and offers visitors the opportunity to enjoy the typical diversity of Zillertal in one exciting weekend. You can visit a variety of locations free of charge (upon presentation of a guest pass from the Zillertal Tourism Association valid for 10+ 11.06.2017). \n\nA brief word of advice: The best way to explore the valley highlights is on a bike ride along the Zillertal cycle route or by taking the Zillertalbahn. \n\n",
