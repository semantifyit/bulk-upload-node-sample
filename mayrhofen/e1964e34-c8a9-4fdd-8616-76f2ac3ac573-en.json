  "description": "My early childhood was shaped by the beauty of the local mountains. A passion developed over the course of the years from this fascination, which remains undiminished to this day. To share the uniqueness of this landscape with other people has always been, and will always be of great importance to me. And so, with the founding of Mountain Sports not only did my dreams come true, I also found my true calling for a career.\n\nFor over 10 years, Mountain Sports in Tyrol has been well known to nature lovers and adventurers far beyond the borders of the region for its exceptional, diversified adventure program. Canyoning, rafting, tubing, via ferrata climbs, high ropes courses, mountain climbing, and much more - Mayrhofen is the ideal starting point to discover the multi-faceted alpine world of the Zillertal Alps from the water, mountain, or air. With our alpine school, awaiting you in winter is an exciting mountain sports program as well as ski tours, ice climbing, freeriding, and snowshoe hiking. Welcome to an Eldorado full of mountain adventure, of courses led and expertly supervised by your mountain guide.\n\nExperience a place outside of everyday life which has lost nothing of its originality and force of nature. Mountain Sports is perfect for your family vacation, journey of adventure, and incentives. I\u0027m looking forward to showing you the most beautiful places in my homeland - and always tailored to your personal preferences.",
