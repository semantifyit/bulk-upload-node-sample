  "description": "The \"Zillergrund\" (25 km length) with its impressing reservoir is not only a remar­kable bike- and hike terrain. Above all this place is famous because of less exhaust emission as well as less noise.  A local bus service operates daily during the main season and each passenger re­ceives a 1,50 voucher which can be rufunded against refreshments in one of the restaurants.  (Environment Bonus cannot be redeemed at Plauener Hütte!)\n\nHiking destinations in the Zillergrund\nAlmstüberl, Bärenbad, Bärenbadalm, Einkehr zum Adlerblick, Häusling, In der Au, Kainzenalm, Klaushof, Plauener Hütte, Zillergrund",
