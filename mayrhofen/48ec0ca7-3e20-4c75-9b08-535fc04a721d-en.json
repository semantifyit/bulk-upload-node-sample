In the afternoon we pamper our guests with a cup of coffee and homemade apple pie. Whether it\u0027s yoghurt, cakes or ice-cream; here they’re homemade with milk from our own farm!\n\nYou can also come for breakfast, our guests will be spoiled in the morning with a sumptuous breakfast buffet and in the evening with a 4-course menu in our cozy lounges.",
