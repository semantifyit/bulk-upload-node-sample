  "description": "A little insider tip are the side villages of Mayrhofen. Hippach, Ramsau and Schwendau are not far from the action and the best of all is that you can enjoy the peace here. The inns and hotels have been lovingly decorated with flowers and the gardens are well maintained. Here you will find the green lush meadows with the typical meadow flowers. Small markets and companies with traditional products are not uncommon because im Zillertal is tradition capitalized. Put yourself in another time and enjoy nature to the fullest.",
