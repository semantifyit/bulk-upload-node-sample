  "description": "Finally the time has come. The cross-border, comedic and public association of the new cabaret duo on the stages of the country begins. Gruber and  Gernot are teaming up and unite two positions and views that are surprisingly consistent and unpredictable. And that was exactly what attracted her.\n\nNo wonder. She is such a clever and strong personality, she expects her best years soon, and has a speech which some even call an extremely dangerous, man-stopping weapon. And yet he is the typical Fifty shades of Something with the manners of the old school, he has always regarded itself as a womanizer, but no one else could confirm that.\n\nTwo worlds are meeting each other. Bavaria and Austria, woman and man, provocation and appeasement, unbridled emotion and desperate attempts to control each other. Four eyes on and two opinions about our world, both big and small.\nIn the new program of Gruber \u0026 Gernot the audience has to find out for itself what’s a big lie and what’s nothing but the truth. The two admit only one thing before the first performance: The collaboration of a Bavarian and an Austrian in the heroic fight against the powerful Germany.\n\n\nTickets: \nSeats: Category A: Euro 42,-- / Category B: Euro 40,-- / Category C: Euro 38,--\n \nTicket hotline: +43 5285 6760 \n",
